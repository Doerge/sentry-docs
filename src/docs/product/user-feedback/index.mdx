While event data allows you to collect information about errors in your application, getting any extra helpful feedback can be crucial in determining the root cause of an issue. Sentry provides the ability to collect additional information with User Feedback. The **User Feedback** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) provides you with a list of feedback submissions from users who experienced an error while using your application. Each submission includes the name and email address entered by the user, as well as their description of what happened to produce the error.

In each submission, you can click the “View Event” link, which takes you to the **Issue Details** page for that event (or instance of the issue). From there, you can dig into what caused the issue and start working to resolve it.

## Set Up

Sentry provides two ways to collect user feedback. If you’re using Sentry's JavaScript, you can configure [an embeddable widget](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/user-feedback/) that displays when a user experiences an error. If you’d prefer to use an alternative widget, or you don’t have a JavaScript frontend, you can use the [User Feedback API](https://docs.sentry.io/api/projects/submit-user-feedback/) instead.
