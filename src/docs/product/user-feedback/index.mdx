**User Feedback** provides you with a list of feedback submissions made by users who experienced an error while using your application. Each submission includes the name and email address entered by the user, as well as their description of what happened to produce the error.

From the submission, you can click the “View Event” link, which takes you to the **Issue Details** page for that event (or instance of the issue). From here, you can dig into what caused the issue and start working to resolve it.

Sentry provides two ways to collect user feedback. If you’re using Sentry’s JavaScript SDK, you can configure [an embeddable widget](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/user-feedback/) that displays when a user experiences an error. If you’d prefer to use an alternative widget, or you don’t have a JavaScript frontend, you can use the [User Feedback API](https://docs.sentry.io/api/projects/submit-user-feedback/) instead.
